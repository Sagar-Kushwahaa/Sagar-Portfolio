## My Journey Into Web Development

Hi, I'm Sagar Prasad Kushwaha, a web development enthusiast from Nepal. I come from a technical background with a diploma in Computer Engineering from CTEVT, a 3-year program that introduced me to the fundamentals of programming and problem-solving.

Since then, I've been diving deeper into the world of web development. I’ve learned the basics—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS—and I’m currently exploring frameworks to expand my skills. I’m still early in my tech journey, but every project I build brings me closer to my goal of becoming a full-stack developer.

What truly excites me about tech is the power it gives us to solve real problems. I love building things that are not just functional, but helpful—tools and websites that actually make life easier for people. That’s what keeps me learning and improving every day.

While I’m still gaining experience, I hope to one day start my own company and use what I’ve learned to create something impactful. For now, I’m focused on building, learning, and growing—one project at a time.

Thanks for visiting my portfolio. I’ll be sharing more projects and posts as I continue on this path.
