### Why I Chose Web Development as My Career Path

When I first started learning about technology, I didn’t know exactly what area I wanted to focus on. But as I explored more, one thing kept grabbing my attention—web development. The idea that I could build something from scratch and have it live on the internet for anyone to use was both exciting and powerful.

Web development is everywhere. From simple blogs to complex web apps, it's the backbone of how we interact with the digital world. What attracted me the most was how quickly you can go from an idea to a working product, especially when you're just getting started. Writing some HTML, styling it with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript—it felt like magic at first.

Another reason I chose web development is that it's accessible. With just a laptop and internet connection, I could start learning and building. I didn’t need expensive tools or a big setup. The open-source community also made learning easier, with free resources, tutorials, and forums that helped me whenever I got stuck.

Now, I’m learning more about full-stack development. I'm interested in both frontend and backend, and I enjoy understanding how everything connects—from user interface to database. My long-term goal is to become a full-stack developer and maybe even start my own company someday.

For anyone starting out like me, I’d say this: choose what excites you. For me, it was web development. It made learning fun, and gave me a purpose every time I sat down to write code.
